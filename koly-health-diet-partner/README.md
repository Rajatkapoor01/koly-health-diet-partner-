# KOYL AI - Personalized Diet Recommendation System

KOYL AI is a full-stack AI-powered diet recommendation web application that provides personalized nutrition plans based on health symptoms and food allergies.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend (Next.js + React)
- Modern React interface with TypeScript
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Real-time form validation and user feedback
- Professional UI components with shadcn/ui

### Backend (Python + Flask)
- **RAG Pipeline**: Retrieval Augmented Generation with FAISS vector search
- **AI Models**: 
  - Sentence-BERT (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for semantic retrieval
  - T5-small for text summarization and generation
- **Knowledge Base**: Curated data from PubMed, USDA, EatRight.org, Harvard Nutrition
- **Allergy Filtering**: Intelligent filtering system for food safety

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.8+
- 4GB+ RAM (for AI models)
